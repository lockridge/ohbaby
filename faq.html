                                    All of our ultrasounds are performed by an ARDMS-registered sonographer. This means that our sonographer has obtained a college degree by completing extensive coursework and clinical experience in the field of ultrasound, and has then passed a national board exam given by the American Registry of Diagnostic Medical Sonographers. Bottom line: a board certified sonographer will ensure that your ultrasound is a safe experience for both Mom and Baby, and that your images are of the highest quality. 
	</p>
	<p>
	We strictly adhere to a set of clinically acceptable guidelines concerning the safety of ultrasound. Many other 3D/4D ultrasound centers don't do this.

                                    Ultrasound, also called sonography, uses sound waves to create images of what's going on inside the body. An instrument called a transducer is placed on the skin. The transducer emits high-frequency sound waves, inaudible to human ears, and then records the echoes as the sound waves bounce back from whichever internal structures are being visualized. This information is relayed back to a computer screen in real-time to produce the images you see during your scan!

                                 <p>2D ultrasound is a black and white ultrasound that you are probably used to seeing at your doctor visits.</p>
            
	<p>3D ultrasound adds another dimension to the 2D ultrasound, thereby giving you a better idea of what your baby looks like "in real life."</p>
	<p>4D ultrasound adds the dimension of "time," and is, in essence, a "live" 3D ultrasound. During a 4D ultrasound you will see your baby moving in 3D!</p>

                                    Ultrasound has been used for over 40 years with no evidence of negative effects. 3D and 4D ultrasounds use the same machines and settings that your doctor uses in a normal 2D ultrasound. Even though there have been no adverse effects proven to result from the proper use of ultrasound, here at Oh Baby! we strictly adhere to a set of clinically-accepted guidelines to ensure the safest and most enjoyable experience for you and your baby!</p>
	<p>The American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM) has issued the following statement regarding the safety of ultrasound: "There are no confirmed adverse biological effects on patients or instrument operators caused by exposures from diagnostic ultrasound instruments. Although the possibility exists that such biological effects may be identified in the future, current data indicates that the benefits to patients of the prudent use of diagnostic ultrasound outweigh the risks, if any, that may be present."</p>

                                    That all depends on what you want to see! If you would like to see most or all of Baby at one time, then the earlier you come in the better. We can let you listen to Baby's heartbeat as early as 12 weeks, so from then until around 20 weeks is the best time to see all of baby at once. Don't forget that we can tell you the gender at 15 weeks! Baby's facial features start becoming more apparent between 24-26 weeks. 27-32 weeks is usually the BEST time to see well-defined facial features, and baby still has some wiggle room to allow for the best images. Beyond 35 weeks there is still the possiblity of capturing good images but, due to increased crowding in the uterus and Baby's face sometimes being covered by umbilical cord or placenta, this time frame may not allow for the most desirable views.

                                    Not always. We will try our best to capture the highest-quality images possible, but there are many factors that can affect how well we can see Baby:</p>
                                    
	<p>Baby's position - if Baby is lying with his/her face toward Mom's back, or if the head is too low in Mom's pelvis or too high in Mom's ribs, it may be more difficult to capture good-quality images of Baby's face.</p>
	<p>Mom's tissue - the sound waves of ultrasound have to travel through various body tissues to reach Baby. Skin, adipose tissue, and muscle (the uterine wall) must all be penetrated and each layer of tissue weakens the sound waves as they pass through. The thicker or more dense each layer is (which will vary from person to person), the more the image quality will be affected.</p>
	<p>Amniotic fluid levels - higher levels of amniotic fluid give Baby more room to move around and allow for less obstructions covering the face (such as umbilical cord and placenta). Fluid levels vary from person to person but as a general rule, more fluid creates a better image!</p>
